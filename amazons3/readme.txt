Amazon S3 REST Wrapper - Version 2.1
Joe Danziger (joe@ajaxcf.com)
Released: August 3, 2011


Install
-------
A simple test script is included which demonstrates the use of the CFC.
You must insert your Amazon S3 access keys in the first 2 lines in s3test.cfm,
then just pull it up in a browser.  You also need the <CF_HMAC> custom tag which
required all 5 files in the hmac directory.  Place these in your custom tagpath 
or in the same directory as the sample scripts.


Methods
-------
 ** init(accessKeyID, secretAccessKey) - initialize CFC (both parameters required).
 ** getBuckets() - list all buckets.
 ** putBucket(bucketName, acl, storageLocation) - create a new bucket (acl is optional 
 	and	defaults to public-read, storageLocation is optional and defaults to non-EU.
 	Use 'EU' for the European location contraint).
 ** getBucket(bucketName, prefix, marker, maxKeys, showVersions) - get contents of a bucket 
 	(prefix is optional and matches on the beginning of a key, marker is optional and results
     start from there, maxKeys is optional and restricts the number of objects returned)
 ** deleteBucket(bucketName) - delete a bucket (bucket must be empty).
 ** putObject(bucketName, fileKey, contentType, HTTPtimeout, cacheControl, cacheDays, acl, 
 	storageClass, keyName, uploadDir) - puts an object into a bucket (HTTPtimeout is in 
 	seconds - default is 300; cacheControl tells browser to cache object - default is true; 
 	cacheDays default is 30; acl = access control list; storageClass = S3 Storage Class; 
 	keyName defaults to fileKey; uploadDir defaults to current directory).
 ** getObject(bucketName, fileKey, minutesValid) - get link to an object (minutesValid
     is optional and defaults to 60).
 ** copyObject(oldBucketName, oldFileKey, newBucketName, newFileKey) - copies an object.
 ** renameObject(oldBucketName, oldFileKey, newBucketName, newFileKey) - renames an object.
 ** deleteObject(bucketName, fileKey) - delete an object from a bucket.
 ** objectExists(bucketName, fileKey) - determines if object exists in bucket.
 ** setBucketVersioning(bucketName,versioningStatus) - sets versioning on a bucket.  
    Valid values are 'Enabled' and 'Suspended'
 ** getBucketVersioning(bucketName) - gets current versioning status of bucket. 


 NOTE: You may also access your objects via:
       http://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/name-of-the-object
